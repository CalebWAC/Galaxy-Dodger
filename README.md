# Galaxy Dodger
Galaxy Dodger is a game for the Sprig game console, inspired by Galaxy Trucker and Asteroids.
Dodge and destroy asteroids coming in from all directions. Your spaceship will consist of elements from a randomly chosen pool of components to add a challenge - you might have engines that can go left and right, but not up and down, for example.

One can find the controls by pressing i in the intro screen. When selecting the parts to build your spaceship, use WASD to move the cursor and L to choose the component. Once four components have been selected, the actual game will begin. WASD controls the movement of the spaceship, but will only work if you have an engine facing that direction. K fires lasers from all the cannons on the space. J will rotate the spaceship clockwise if it has a small gray mini booster on one of the engines. Avoid or blow up the asteroids for as long as you can.
